# Summary

Okay, so what did we learn?

- The easiest way to think of prototypal inheritance is that it's basically a system where we'll check another object for a property if it's not on the one we're working with.
- Any object can be the prototype for another object, but a lot of times we make special objects that serve as the blueprint for a "class" of objects.
- Object literals are just short-hand for making new instances of `Object`,
- The prototype object for all objects is `Object.prototype`.
- All objects made this way will inherit from `Object.prototype`.
- `Object.prototype` has some helpful methods on it.
